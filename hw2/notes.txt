yoda - talk, I will
understand but doesn't seem to follow ordinary rules
why? because not occuring in correct order

let's say a sentence has two parts (Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase):
S -> NP VP

NP -> noun
	could be simple such as just a name (rob)
	or could contain art adj noun
VP -> verb
	Rob slept
	Rob -> nounprhase, slept -> verb phrase
NP and VP can be named anything

Math

if just 1 +, could not compute because incomplete

E -> handles + and -
T -> * and /
F -> a number

math is recursive
	in 1 + 2 + 3, we would have to use E several times 
E -> T + E | T - E | T
T -> F * T | F / T | F

Example:
1 * 2 + 3

Start off with non-terminal E 

1 + 2 + 3
 
   E
T      E
	


(see notes to see diagram)

state = e
if state == e and input is a number:
	state = f
elif state == e and input is a + or -:
	state = e

valid python
if x == y:
	print "Same"
elif x < y
	print "Less
else:
	print "more"

how do rules look in python?
